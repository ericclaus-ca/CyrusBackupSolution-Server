.SYNOPSIS
    Creates HTML pages containing histories of various items backup history.    

.DESCRIPTION
    This script contains a list of all backups, and their backup directories, to check the
    history of. The script takes this list and uses the Show-BackupStatusHistory function
    to get a table containing all backup files for each item being checked. It then creates
    HTML pages containing these tables, one for each backed up item listed in the script.

    Requirements:
        * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup VLAN admin account password.

function Backup-NAS1 {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Performs Full or Incremental backups on the NAS.    

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the 7Zip4PowerShell module to compress, encrypt, and backup the file shares on NAS1.
        All folders inside of the NASShare folder on NAS1 are backed up.

        When an incremental backup is performed, only files modifed since the last backup was completed will be backed up.
        
        Requirements:
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup encryption key.
            * Must have access to (ie. on the same user account and computer as) the secure password file containing the backup VLAN admin account password.

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-NAS1 -Type Full
        Perform a full backup of the file shares on NAS1

    .EXAMPLE
        Backup-NAS1 -Type Incremental
        Perform an incremental backup of the file shares on NAS1

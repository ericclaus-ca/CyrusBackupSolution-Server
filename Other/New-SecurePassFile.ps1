<#.SYNOPSISCreates a secure password file which can be used to retrieve the password at a later time. .DESCRIPTIONThis is a Powershell function to create a secure password file. It can be run one time tocreate a secure password that will be used in scripts that require automation. It prompts for the password to be entered and then converts it to a secure string and savesit to a file. It returns the path to the secure password file as a string. The file name israndomly generated and the directory it is located in can be either left to the default pathdefined in the script, or a directory specified with the -PwdFileDir parameter. This function must be run on the same computer and by the same user account that will run any scripts that reference the secure password file. This function can be used in conjuction with Get-SecurePassword to store a secure passwordand then reference it as plain text in a script. It is useful for scripts that require both automation and plain text passwords.   See Get-SecurePassword to convert the secure password file to a plain text password in scripts. .INPUTSThis script does not accept any inputs. .OUTPUTS[string] path to the secure password file. .EXAMPLENew-SecurePassFile.ps1Prompts for a password, then converts it to a secure string and saves the file to the default directory. .EXAMPLENew-SecurePassFile "C:\myPwds\"Prompts for a password, then converts it to a secure string and saves the file to the "C:\myPwds\" directory. .NOTESAuthor: Eric ClausLast Modified: 11/07/2017Based on code from Shawn Melton (@wsmelton), http://blog.wsmelton.com .LINKhttps://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-secure-your-passwords-with-powershell/#>Param(    [string]$PwdFileDir = "C:\Scripts") $PwdFile = "$PwdFileDir\$(Get-Random)" #If (Test-Path $PwdFile) {    #New-SecurePassFile $PwdFileDir#} $Password = (Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the password to add to the file" -AsSecureString) ConvertFrom-SecureString -SecureString $Password | Out-File $PwdFile echo $PwdFile
